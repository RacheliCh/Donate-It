Secondhand Clothing â€“ Made Easy

## Description
This project aims to make donating and shopping for secondhand clothes easier.\
After taking a picture of the item using the special stand, it will automatically upload to an online clothing catalog.\
The stand includes a touch screen and is not PC-based, so it simple to use by non-tech-savvy people.
